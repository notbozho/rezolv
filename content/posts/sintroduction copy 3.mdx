## What is Web3 Auditing?

Web3 auditing involves the process of reviewing decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts to find potential vulnerabilities, security issues, or inefficiencies in the code. This process ensures that the code behaves as intended and secures user funds or data from malicious actors.

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
