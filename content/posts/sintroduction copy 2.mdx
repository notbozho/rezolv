# How to Get Started with Web3 Auditing

Web3 auditing is an essential process for ensuring the security and efficiency of decentralized protocols and smart contracts. Whether you're just starting out or you're an experienced developer, understanding the tools and methodologies involved in Web3 auditing is crucial.

Hereâ€™s a quick introduction video:

## What is Web3 Auditing?

Web3 auditing involves the process of reviewing decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts to find potential vulnerabilities, security issues, or inefficiencies in the code. This process ensures that the code behaves as intended and secures user funds or data from malicious actors.

```solidity
function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) returns (uint256) {
    return a + b; // @audit kurec
}
```
